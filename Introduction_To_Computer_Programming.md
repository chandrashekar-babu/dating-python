# Introduction to Computer Programming

## Dawn of Mankind: The power to create tools
[* image: evolution chain *]
A human being can be seen as the most distinct creature in this planet when compared to other living creatures in one important aspect - the ability to create tools from objects around them to overcome physical and mental limitations.

The earliest of mankind used sharp objects (made up of bones of other dead animals and/or wood) to defend themselves from being attacked by other wild animals. Eventually, they began using these sharp objects as weapons for hunting down other docile animals for food. As mankind evolved, they began to create better tools like clubs, daggers, bow and arrow, swords and knives as their ability to learn and exploit objects evolved better - from using sticks, bones and stones to smelting metal. Since then, mankind raced past other living species to become the most prominent species in this planet.  While most of the earliest mankind used tools to create weapons and machines to augment their physical strength, slowly they also evolved to create tools that augment mental limitations.

The earliest of mental augmentation tools used by mankind where inscriptions and engravings on rocks. This allowed storage and communication of message across generations, and also served as a technique of “remembering” an event by “storing” them outside the human brain. This earliest technique eventually evolved to drawing/painting/sculpture art and also written language as means of storing and conveying knowledge across generations of mankind.

When mankind evolved to learn and apply the method of counting, addition, subtraction and basic arithmetic, he invented tools to automate this mental calculation too. This earliest tool known to us today that allowed our ancestors before 2000 years to perform calculations with minimal mental stress was called **Abacus** and is attributed today as one of the earliest computers created by mankind.

We have come a long way since our known human history of about 7000 years in learning and mastering the art of creating tools, complex machinery and computers that augment our “human” limitations. We have used almost every accessible natural resource to create these machines and also learnt how to exploit naturally available fuel resources to power them.

In our knowledge/skill evolution time-lines, we have observed that neanderthals were predominantly hunter-gatherers, early civilisations were skilled in agriculture, later civilisations became skilled in making mechanical tools and machinery to simplify their routine work. Invention of steam engine, diesel and other fuel engines lead mankind to the Industrial revolution where most men learnt how to operate complex machinery. Thus, most people were mechanical engineers / machine operators since the industrial revolution. With the dawn of digital computer electronics in the previous century, there has been a rapid progress and growth towards “programming” these machines to reduce human intervention for performing mundane jobs. Today we are basking on the glory of “Age of computing and Information Technology”. Now, to use these computers effectively, we *must* know a little bit of programming. 

## Computers then… and today.

The invention of the filament light bulb and the subsequent invention of vacuum tubes dawned the electronics revolution in the early 20th century.
With the birth of electronics arrived the age of digital electronics and digital computing. Except that, the semiconductor technology replaced the old electromechanical relays and vacuum tubes. With decades of engineering, we now have come to a phase where the power of computation of the first digital electronic computer (ENIAC) which spanned closed to 1800 square feet and weighed approximately 170 tons is now available within a micro controller of a mouse.

## Man and the Machine
One of the most intriguing challenges that we have been facing since our obsession with machines is a way to make these machines perform their job as we intend them to. For these machines to perform their job, there has to some kind of hardwired instructions. These instructions could be setup as gears and levers each of them sequenced to perform a particular job - imagine an old generation clock or even an analogue wrist watch. 

## Programming the computer
As computers have become part of our daily lives in the form of smartphones, smart television, ebook readers, smart media players, smart tablets and so on, we have in our current generation learnt to live with them. All these gadgets, instruments and machines are being manufactured and them “programmed” to make our lives easy. With the increasing number of gadgets embedded with computers in them, it has become increasingly challenging to program them. Currently, programming needs human intervention as machines cannot develop programs - not yet. 

 About 500 years ago, not everyone knew how to read and write and amongst literates, not many knew math and science. But over the last century, math and science became a part of elementary schooling in order to empower those who completed schooling to make better judgements in their career based on the attained knowledge.

With the emergence of pervasive computing, programming no longer is a part of computer engineer’s subject.  Programming is a skill that helps any human being become competent in logical and rational thinking. Writing programs can start off as a simple brain-training exercise like solving rubick’s cube or a jigsaw puzzle. But, with levels of sophistication, it allows us to perceive the world around us in a more rational way.
